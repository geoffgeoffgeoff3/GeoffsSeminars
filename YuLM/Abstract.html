<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Lemmas can provide valuable help for constructing a proof, by providing
intermediate steps. 
However, not all the formulae supplied to an ATP system as lemmas are 
necessarily helpful. 
It is therefore necessary to develop lemma management techniques that 
use the right lemmas at the right time, to improve the problem-solving 
ability of ATP systems. 
This paper presents three lemma management techniques, 
reports on their implementation, and illustrates their potential with
example problems.
