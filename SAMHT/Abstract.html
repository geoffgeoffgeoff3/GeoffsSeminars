SAMHT - Suicidal Avatars for Mental Health Training
</H1>

<H3> Abstract </H3>

Psychosocial assessments and treatments are effective for a range of
psychological problems.
One particular area of concern is youth suicide.
This paper reports on the SAMHT intelligent tutoring system, which provides
youth suicide risk assessment training.
SAMHT's interactive avatar interface is based on an intelligent backend,
and provides a believable interaction that is effective for training
mental health professionals.
