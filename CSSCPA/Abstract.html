<H3> Abstract </H3>

Key concerns in the development of more powerful ATP systems are
to provide <EM>breadth</EM> of coverage - an ability to solve a large range of 
problems, and to provide greater <EM>depth</EM> of coverage - an ability to 
solve more difficult problems, within the same resource limits.
This work describes the design and implementation of CSSCPA, a 
compositional competition-cooperation parallel ATP System.
CSSCPA combines existing high performance ATP systems in a framework that
allows them to work independently, but also allows communication of 
intermediate results.
The performance data shows that CSSPCA has high breadth and depth of 
coverage.
