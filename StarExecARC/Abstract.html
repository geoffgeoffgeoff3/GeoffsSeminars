Towards StarExec in the Cloud
</H1>

<H3> Abstract </H3>

StarExec has been central to much progress in logic solvers over the last 10 years.
It was recently announced that StarExec Iowa will be decommissioned, and while StarExec Miami
will continue to operate while funding is available, it will not be able to support all the
logic solver communities currently using the larger StarExec Iowa.
In the long term StarExec will necessarily have to migrate to new compute environments.
This talk describes work being done to reengineer StarExec as a cloud-native application using
container technology and infrastructure-as-code practices.
Supported by an Amazon Research Award, a new version of StarExec will be deployed in AWS.
