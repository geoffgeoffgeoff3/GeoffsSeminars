Solving QMLTP Problems<BR>
by Translation to Higher-order Logic
</H1>

<H3> Abstract </H3>

This work describes an evaluation of Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) systems 
on problems taken from the QMLTP library of first-order modal logic problems. 
Principally, the problems are translated to higher-order logic in the TPTP 
languages using an embedding approach, and solved using higher-order logic 
ATP systems. 
Additionally, the results from native modal logic ATP systems are considered, 
and compared with those from the embedding approach.
