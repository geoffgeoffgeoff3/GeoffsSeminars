Quality Metric for Proofs
</H1>

<H2> Our Interests </H2>
<UL>
<LI> Ranking proofs (can be used for evaluation of solvers)
<LI> Improving proofs
<LI> Selecting proofs for different uses
<LI> Displaying proofs to different users
</UL>

<H2> Our Needs </H2>
<UL>
<LI> Ways of accepting something as a proof
<LI> Quantitative metrics for ranking proofs
<LI> Ways to partially order proofs by quality
</UL>

<H2> Questions that Arise </H2>
<UL>
<LI> What constitutes an acceptable solution from a logic solver?
     <UL>
     <LI> What does NOT constitute an acceptable solution/output?
     </UL>
<LI> What features of solutions should be used to assess their quality?
     <UL>
     <LI> What features should NOT be used?
     <LI> What features are developer-specific, what features are 
          user-specific, and what features are globally important?
     </UL>
<LI> What mechanisms (should) exist by which existing solutions can 
     be postprocessed to improve their quality?
<LI> Is a common verification/validation process possible/desirable for 
     a broad range of logics and their solvers' solutions?
<LI> Provide some examples from current solvers' solutions that illustrate 
     good and bad solutions, wrt points previously addressed.
</UL>
