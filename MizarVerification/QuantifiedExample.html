<UL>
<LI> <TT>Let</TT> rule: "let's have an arbitrary but fixed x"
<LI> Introduces a new constant to instantiate a universally quantified thesis 
<LI> Similar rules for existential quantifiers: <TT>Take</TT>, <TT>Consider</TT>

Lemma1: for x being set holds p(x)         ;; this has been proved already 
Lemma2: for x being set holds p(x) => q(x) ;; this has been proved already 
Goal1: for x being set holds q(x) 
proof                  ;; (Proof) thesis (Goal1) is: for x being set holds q(x) 
  let new_constant be set;               ;; (Let) thesis (T1) is: q(new_constant) 
  E1: p(new_constant) by Lemma1;         ;; (JustifiedProposition) thesis unchanged 
  thus E2: q(new_constant) by Lemma2,E1; ;; (Conclusion) thesis (T2) is: verum
