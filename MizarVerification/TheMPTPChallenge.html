<UL>
<LI> Two sets of 252 problems generated from a part of MML 
<LI> The 252 theorems recursively needed for one implication of the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem (the root theorem of the Challenge)
<P>
<LI> Hundreds of symbols and definitions, ca. 1400 TPTP formulas 
<LI> Symbols and formulas are named consistently in all problems
<LI> A suitably large subDAG of the MML useful for experimenting with ATP methods in large theories
<LI> The two sets differ in the amount of unnecessary axioms added to the problems ("all previous knowledge" vs. "only necessary knowledge")
<P>
<LI> May 2007: only 199 of the 252 problems (79%) have been solved by any ATP system
