ATP Cross-Verification of the <BR>
Mizar MPTP Challenge Problems
</H1>

<H3> Abstract </H3>

Mizar is a proof assistant used for formalization and mechanical verification 
of mathematics. 
The main use of Mizar is in the development of the Mizar Mathematical Library 
(MML), in which proofs are verified by the Mizar proof checker. 
The Mizar proof checker has a quite complex implementation, and also lacks 
the ability to print out detailed atomic proof steps in a format that is 
easy to verify by an independent proof-checking tool. 
This can raise concerns about the correctness of the MML. 
This paper describes how a Mizar-to-ATP translation (the MPTP system), ATP 
verification tools (the GDV system), and Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) 
systems, have been used for an independent crossverification of a part of 
the MML.
