<UL>
<LI> Reasoning in very large theories is an interesting AI field
<UL>
<LI> Mathematicians have many theorems and proofs in their heads
<LI> Need methods for selecting axioms, generating lemmas, learning from previous proofs, defining useful concepts, ...
<LI> SRASS, MaLARea, Paulson &amp; Meng, Petr Pudlak
<LI> Submit your system to the new batch mode of CASC
<LI> Submit your paper to a special issue of JSC
</UL>
<P>
<LI> Mizar verifier has a complicated implementation
<LI> Use ATP for independent verification of the MML (in this work, the MPTP Challenge problems)
<LI> Mizar does not produce low-level proof objects:<BR>
     Use ATP proof objects to communicate with other proof assistants in large projects like Flyspeck
<LI> Lots of mathematical problems for testing and improving ATPs
