<LI> 14 of 17 problems solved by expert pruning of the background knowledge<BR>
     (could probably be automated for large sets of problems)
<LI> 3 problems could not be solved
     <UL>
     <LI> A background axiom was omitted by the MPTP translation
     <LI> Probably countersatisfiable (not confirmed yet)
     <LI> All from one challenge problem
     <LI> Easily solved after addition of the missing background axiom
     </UL>
<P>
<LI> Final result: 
     <UL>
     <LI> 251 challenge problems verified
     <LI> 1 challenge problem probably countersatisfiable<BR>
          (verified after adding the missing background axiom)
     <LI> Found a rare case of incompleteness of the MPTP translation algorithm
