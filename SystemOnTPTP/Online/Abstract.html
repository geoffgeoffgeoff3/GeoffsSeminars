<H3> Abstract </H3>

SystemOnTPTP is a WWW interface that allows an ATP problem to be easily
and quickly submitted in various ways to a range of ATP systems. The
interface uses a suite of currently available ATP systems. The interface
allows the problem to be selected from the TPTP library or for a problem
written in TPTP syntax to be provided by the user. The problem may be
submitted to one or more of the ATP systems in sequence, or may be
submitted via the SSCPA interface to multiple systems in parallel.
SystemOnTPTP also can provide system recommendations for a problem.
