Component-based Automated Reasoning </H1>

<H3> Abstract </H3>

The development and deployment of component-based automated reasoning systems
relies on an adequate infrastructure of standards and tools that allow the
component systems to execute and interact in a controlled and reliable way.
In the field of 1st order automated reasoning there has been limited 
standardization across the available component systems, resulting in adhoc 
combination techniques and a limited range of general purpose tools.
This work presents two emerging standards in the 1st order automated reasoning
community, whose adoption is leading to greater compatibility between component
systems.
Six general purpose tools that conform to these standards are then described.
The standards and tools facilitate direct communication between components
of complex systems, providing seamless integration and greater reasoning
productivity.
