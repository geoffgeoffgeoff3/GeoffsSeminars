<H3><EM>
There is a well established infrastructure that supports research, development, and deployment  
of Automated Reasoning systems, stemming from the Thousands of Problems for Theorem Provers 
(TPTP) problem library.
</EM> </H3>

<H3><EM>
The TPTP syntax ... has become a de facto standard for formulating and exchanging logical problems 
for automated theorem provers.
</EM> </H3>

<H3><EM>
The SZS ontology provides a fine grained ontology of result and output forms that are used to 
specify what has been established about a given ATP problem.
</EM> </H3>

<H3><EM>
Evaluating ATP problems is important as it simplifies problem selection according to a user's 
intentions, and over the years, changes in problem ratings provide a quantitative indicator of 
advancement in ATP.
</EM> </H3>

<H3><EM>
It is widely accepted that CASC has been a catalyst for the impressive progress that has taken 
place since then in the development of the current high-performance provers.
