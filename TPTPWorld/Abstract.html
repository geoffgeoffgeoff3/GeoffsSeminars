<H3> Abstract </H3>

The TPTP World is a well known and established infrastructure that supports
research, development, and deployment of Automated Theorem Proving (ATP)
systems for classical logics.
The data, standards, and services provided by the TPTP World have made it
increasingly easy to build, test, and apply ATP technology.
This talk and tutorial reviews the core features of the TPTP World,
describes key service components of the TPTP World and how to use them,
and presents some successful applications.
