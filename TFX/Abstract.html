TFX: The TPTP Extended Typed First-order Form
</H1>

<H3> Abstract </H3>

The TPTP world is a well established infrastructure that supports research, 
development, and deployment of Automated Theorem Proving systems for 
classical logics. 
The TPTP language is one of the keys to the success of the TPTP world. 
Originally the TPTP world supported only first-order clause normal form (CNF). 
Over the years support for full first-order form (FOF), monomorphic typed 
first-order form (TF0), rank-1 polymorphic typed first-order form (TF1), 
monomorphic typed higher-order form (TH0), and rank-1 polymorphic typed 
higher-order form (TH1), have been added. 
TF0 and TF1 together form the TFF language family; TH0 and TH1 together form 
the THF language family. 
This talk introduces the eXtended Typed First-order form (TFX), which extends
TFF to include boolean terms, tuples, conditional expressions, and let 
expressions.
