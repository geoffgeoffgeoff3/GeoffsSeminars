A Chat with Bard
</H1>

<H3> Abstract </H3>

Given all the excitement around ChatGPT, Bard, Bing, etc., we decided to test 
Bardâ€™s logical reasoning powers. 
Bard was given the English description of the TPTP problem <TT>PUZ001+1</TT> - 
"Who Killed Aunt Agatha?", modified to really ask that question. 
This short talk documents the story that unfolded, and how tools from the 
TPTP World were used to examine the output from Bard.
