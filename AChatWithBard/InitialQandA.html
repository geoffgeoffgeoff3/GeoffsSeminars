<H3> The Answer </H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>
From point 4, we know Agatha hates Charles. 
Since Charles hates no one that Aunt Agatha hates (point 3), Charles does not 
hate Aunt Agatha. 
Thus, Charles cannot be the killer since a killer hates his victim. 
From points 5 and 6, we know the butler hates everyone not richer than 
Aunt Agatha and everyone that Aunt Agatha hates. 
Since Agatha hates everyone except the butler (point 4), the butler hates 
Charles. 
According to point 7, no one hates everyone, so the butler doesnâ€™t hate Agatha. 
The only person left is Aunt Agatha. 
Since we know that Charles and the butler cannot be the killers, and Agatha 
is not Charles and Charles is not the butler, it implies that Agatha must 
have killed herself.
