<H3> Why is Surface Area Important to Normal Cell Function? </H3>
<UL>
<LI> "A high surface-to-volume ratio facilitates the exchange of materials 
     between a cell and its environment."
<LI> Implicit commonsense and biological knowledge
<LI> The answer is in the explanation - the reasoning 
     <UL>
     <LI> Assurance is not enough
     </UL>
</UL>

<H3> Implicit Commonsense Knowledge </H3>
<UL>
<LI> Every cell has a surface area and a surface-to-volume ratio
<LI> Surface area is proportional to surface-to-volume ratio
<LI> Proportional is symmetric and transitive
<LI> If something is important, and is proportional to another
     thing, then the other thing is also important<BR>
     (importance is transferred by proportionality)
</UL>

<H3> Implicit Biological Knowledge </H3>
<UL>
<LI> Every cell has an environment.
<LI> Every cell and environment have an exchange rate 
<LI> The exchange rate is important.
</UL>

<H3> Two Encodings for ATP </H3>
<UL>
<LI> Shallow, which gives the intuition
<LI> Deep, which gives the power
<LI> Shallow &ne; Deep
</UL>
