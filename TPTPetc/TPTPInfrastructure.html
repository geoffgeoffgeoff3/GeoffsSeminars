<H3><EM>
There is a well established infrastructure that supports research,
development, and deployment  of Automated Theorem Proving (ATP)
systems, stemming from the Thousands of Problems for Theorem Provers (TPTP)
problem library.
</EM> </H3>

<H3><EM>
The TPTP syntax ... has become a de facto standard for formulating
and exchanging logical problems for automated theorem provers.
</EM> </H3>

<H3><EM>
The SZS ontology provides a fine grained ontology of result and
output forms that are used to specify what has been established about a given
ATP problem.
</EM> </H3>

<H3><EM>
Evaluating ATP problems is important as it simplifies problem selection 
according to a user's intentions, and over the years, changes in problem 
ratings provide a quantitative indicator of advancement in ATP.
</EM> </H3>

<H3><EM>
It is widely accepted that the six CASCs held so far (since 1996) have been 
a catalyst for the impressive progress that has taken place since then in 
the development of the current high-performance provers.
