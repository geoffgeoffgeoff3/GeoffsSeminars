Automated Reasoning in Practice
</H1>

<H3> Abstract </H3>

This talk gives an overview of activities and products that stem from
the Thousands of Problems for Theorem Provers (TPTP) problem library
for Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) systems.
These include the TPTP itself,
the Thousands of Solutions from Theorem Provers (TSTP) solution library,
the TPTP language,
the CADE ATP System Competition (CASC),
tools such as my semantic Derivation Verifier (GDV) and the Interactive
Derivation Viewer (IDV),
meta-ATP systems such as the Smart Selective Competition Parallelism (SSCPA)
system and the Semantic Relevance Axiom Selection System (SRASS),
online access to automated reasoning systems and tools through the SystemOnTPTP
web service, and applications in various domains.
Current work extending the TPTP to higher-order logic will be introduced.
