     Note how the signatures of symbols whose arity is greater than 1 are 
     provided in curried form, which allows for partial application.

<H3> Challenge problem </H3>
Andrew, Betty, and Charlie are (different) people.
Andrew loves himself, Betty does not love herself.
Selfish love is a relationship between two (different) people in which
the second person loves themself (and the first person is ignored).
Prove that there exists a property of a person that is true for Andrew
but not for Betty.
