<H1>A Challenge Theorem</H1>

Garfield is a cat and Odie is a dog. Cats and dogs are pets. Jon
is a human. Every pet has a human owner. Jon owns Garfield and
Odie, and they are the only cat and dog he owns. If a dog chases
a cat, then the cat's owner hates the dog's owner. Odie has chased
Garfield. Therefore, Jon hates himself.
