</H1>

<H3> Abstract </H3>

This talk describes a new format for representing Tarskian-style 
interpretations for formulae in typed first-order logic, using the TPTP 
TF0 language. 
It further describes a technique and an implemented tool for verifying models 
using this representation, and a tool for visualizing interpretations. 
The research contributes to the advancement of automated reasoning technology 
for model finding, which has several applications, including verification.
