Larry Wos - Visions of Automated Reasoning
</H1>

<H3> Abstract </H3>

This talk celebrates the scientific discoveries and the service to the
automated reasoning community of Lawrence (Larry) T. Wos, who passed away 
in August 2020. The talk covers Larry's most long-lasting ideas about 
inference rules and search strategies for theorem proving, his work on 
applications of theorem proving, and a collection of personal memories 
and anecdotes that let us appreciate Larry's personality and enthusiasm 
for automated reasoning.
