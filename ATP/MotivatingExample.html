The Venezuelan car manufacturer "Sucre" has been developing a futuristic 
electric car, called the Quipos.
The Quipos has only three digital control circuits: 
the Energy Control Circuit (ECQ), 
the Wheel Control Circuit (WCQ), and
the Human Haptics Detection (HHD) circuit (don't blame me for their strange
acronyms).
During development one of the circuits was repeatedly sending faulty signals 
to the WCQ, causing it to fail, with corresponding downstream impact on the 
car's self-steering and automatic braking features.
The engineers needed to determine which circuit was sending the faulty signals
to the WCQ.
The following facts were known about the signals being sent between the 
circuits:
<UL>
<LI> A sending circuit causes a receiving circuit to fail by sending it 
     (faulty) signals.
<LI> A sending circuit never uses more power than the receiving circuit.
<LI> The ECQ never sent signals to circuits that the WCQ sent signals to. 
<LI> The WCQ sent signals to all the circuits except the HHD.
<LI> The HHD sent signals to all the circuits that did not use more power than
     the WCQ.
<LI> The HHD sent signals to all the circuits that that the WCQ sent signals to.
<LI> No circuit sent signals to every circuit. 
</UL>

Automated Theorem Proving was used to analyse this issue, and it turned out
that the WCQ was sending faulty signals to itself, causing itself to fail!
