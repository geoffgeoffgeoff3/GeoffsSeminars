<BLOCKQUOTE ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
The reviewer, just like probably most readers of the AI journal, believes 
that the style of systems as compared here in the TPTP competition (search 
based fully automatic TP systems), whose intellectual roots are still in the 
seventies and early eighties, are misguided ("intellectually frozen in a 
time warp of the early days and only kept alive by such a small isolated 
but dedicated community" is a famous value judgement by a well known worker 
in the field). Hence these competitions are not only a waste of time, but 
they are counterproductive as they lure the young researcher into a style 
of work that is essentially wasted and <B><EM>the organizers</EM></B> - 
more or less identical with the authors of this paper - 
<B><EM>should be forced to drink the 
poisoned cup of Socrates for corrupting the youth</EM></B>.
