<H3> Abstract </H3>

The Vampire Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) system has been very successful
at proving theorems in first-order logic. Vampire has won the First-Order
Form (FOF) division of the CADE ATP System Competition (CASC) for all except
one of the last 15 years, and many papers highlighting Vampire's strengths
have been published. This talk examines the flip side of the Vampire coin ...
what kinds of problems are difficult or even impossible for the latest
incarnation of Vampire. The talk will help users decide when to use Vampire,
and when to use another ATP system, will help the Vampire developers direct
their work, and provides the data required to build a portfolio ATP system
with Vampire as a component.
