<H3> Definition </H3>
<UL>
<LI> A <EM>relevance measure</EM> measures relevance of a formula to a
     conjecture
<LI> Necessarily approximate (or P = NP)
<LI> Used to include/exclude formulae from a proof attempt
<LI> Related to <EM>quality measures</EM> which order formulae for use as
     parents
</UL>

<H3> Previous Work </H3>
<UL>
<LI> Common syntactic CNF quality measures
<LI> System specific FOF quality measures
<LI> Plaisted & Yayha, Veroff's relevance measures use possibility of 
     inference from formula abstractions
<LI> RedAx relevance measure used formula weight
</UL>

<H3> Principle of "Aboutness" </H3>
<UL>
<LI> Is the formula "talking about the same things" as the conjecture?
<LI> Measure extent to which they share predicates and functors
<LI> Also used for partition-based reasoning
</UL>
