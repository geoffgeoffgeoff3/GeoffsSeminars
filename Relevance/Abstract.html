<H1 ALIGN=CENTER> Proving Hard Theorems in Rich Theories, Part II </H1>

<H3> Abstract </H3>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
A <EM>Rich Theory</EM> is one whose axioms (expressed in 1st order logic) 
contain a large number of predicates and functors, and whose theorems are 
often provable from a subset of the axioms.
Experimental results have shown that the removal of just a few unnecessary
axioms can have a significant effect on the performance of an ATP system
on a problem.
This work introduces a relevance measure that estimates the potential 
usefulness of an axiom for proving a given theorem.
The measure has been used in a control algorithm that selects combinations
of axioms based on their relevance, to form {\em axiom reduced} problems
that are submitted to an ATP system.
Evaluation shows that this system performs better than the ATP system alone.
Additionally, a scheme for using the relevance measures for selecting lemmas
to augment the axioms of a problem is introduced.
