<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
The event calculus is a powerful and highly usable formalism for
reasoning about action and change.
The discrete event calculus limits time to integers.
This paper shows how discrete event calculus problems can be encoded
in first-order logic, and solved using a first-order logic
automated theorem proving system.
The following techniques are discussed:
reification is used to convert event and fluent atoms into first-order terms,
uniqueness-of-names axioms are generated to ensure uniqueness of event and
fluent terms,
predicate completion is used to convert second-order circumscriptions
into first-order formulae, and
a limited first-order axiomatization of integer arithmetic
is developed.
The performance of first-order automated theorem proving is compared
to that of satisfiability solving.
