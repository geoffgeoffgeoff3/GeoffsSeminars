<H3> Abstract </H3>

<P>
The equivalence of different axiomatizations of modal logics is well
known and documented in the literature, e.g., S5 may be equivalently
axiomatized by PC + necessitation + K (distribution) + M + 5, and by
S1<SUP>0</SUP> + M6 + S3 + M9 + B.
Many proofs of equivalence are available from books.
Some proofs of equivalence have been done using automated theorem proving
(ATP) systems.
This seminar describes some early work in a project whose goal is to
build an online database of equivalence proofs that have been found
using ATP.

modal logic knowledge that is necessary for this work.</EM>
