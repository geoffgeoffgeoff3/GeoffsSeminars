Release v7.1.0, Tue Mar 6 12:00:10 EST 2018

This release provides an introduction to the extended TFF syntax, in which
(i) formulae can be used as terms with the type $o, (ii) variables of type $o
can be used as formulae, (iii) tuple terms and tuple types are available as
first-class citizens, and (iv) conditional and let expressions are supported.
Corresponding changes to the THF syntax for conditional and let expressions.
There are no problems in this TPTP release that use the extended TFF syntax,
and instead a separate .tgz is available with sample problems. The SyntaxBNF
file provides the extended syntax, and the changes are listed below.

Changes from v7.0.0 to v7.1.0 for THF problems
  0 new abstract problems.
130 new problems, in the domains NUM NUN SYN.
  0 new generators.

 23 new abstract problems, in the domains SYO.
 24 new problems, in the domains SYO.

+ In SyntaxBNF
  In THF:
  - <thf_subtype> moved from <thf_logic_formula> to <thf_formula>
  - <thf_unitary_formula> reduced to contain only quantified, unary, atom,
    and ()ed formulae.
  - <thf_binary_pair> renamed to <thf_binary_nonassoc>, <thf_binary_tuple>
    renamed to <thf_binary_assoc>.
  - <thf_variable_list> changed to use <thf_typed_variable> instead of
    <thf_variable>, because <thf_variable> included <variable> which was a
    hangover from the default typing of TFF.
  - <thf_atom> extended to include <atom> (moved up from <thf_function>) and
    <thf_tuple> (moved down from thf_unitary_formula>).
  - <thf_conn_term> in <thf_atom> must now be ()ed, i.e., to make a connective
    into a term it must be ()ed.
  - <thf_atom> extended to include <thf_conditional> and <thf_let> (moved down
    from <thf_unitary_formula>).
  - <thf_function> renamed to <thf_fof_function> (to show it captures the
    first-order style of writing things).
  - <thf_tuple> reverted back to using only []s (no {}s).
    <thf_let> changed to new syntax.
  - <thf_typeable_formula> reduced to allow only <thf_atom> (no ()s).
  - <thf_unitary_type> allows tuple types, because <thf_unitary_formula> leads
    to <thf_atom>, to <thf_function>, to <thf_tuple>. Loose syntax!
  In TFF: Big changes to accomodate TFX, including ...
  - <tff_subtype> moved from <tff_logic_formula> to <tff_formula>
  - <tff_sequent> removed. That construct is now in the TFX language.
  - <tff_unit_formula> added for use in binary formulae.
  - <tff_preunit_formula> added for use in <tff_prefix_unary>.
  - <tff_logic_formula> extended to include unary formulae.
  - <tff_unary_formula> split into prefix and infix
  - <tff_conditional> and <tff_let> moved from <tff_unitary_formula> to
    <tff_defined_plain>.
  - <tff_unitary_term> added for use in <tff_defined_infix> and
    <tff_infix_unary>.
  - <tfx_tuple> added, for use in <tff_term> and <tff_unitary_term>.
  - <tff_typed_atom> renamed to <tff_atom_typing>.
  - <tff_atomic_type> extended to include <tfx_tuple_type>, because the TFX
    language uses the same type declaration rules.
  In FOF:
  - <fof_logic_formula> extended to include <fof_unary_formula> (previously
    in <fof_unitary_formula>).
  - <tff_conditional_term> and <tff_let_term> removed from <fof_term>. Those
    constructs are now only in TFX and THF.
  - <tff_tuple_term> removed from <fof_function_term>.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Specified that the quantification in a $let must be universal.
  - Added ()s around the <thf_let_plain_defn> in a <thf_let_quantified_defn>
    (to avoid binding ambiguity).
  - Changed $ite to be an instance of a <thf_unitary_formula>, so it uses
    application rather than FOF style $ite(...).
  - Added := to the THF binary connectives, to accomodate logic specifications.
    This changed $let to use <thf_unitary_formula> for it's first arguments;
    the original rule hierarchy for $let has been changed to :== semantic
    rules. Semantic rules for logic specifications have been added.
  - Added := to the TFF binary connectives, to accomodate logic specifications.
  - Split off TFX language, for FOOL and modal logic.
  - Renamed things to separate THF from TFF from FOF from general
  - Added <tff_subtype> back

  - Added <thf_apply_type> to <thf_top_level_type>
  - Updated comment about number of languages, and comment saying all variables
    except CNF must be quantified.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release v3.6.0, Tue Dec 16 05:01:29 EST 2008

Changes from v3.5.0 to v3.6.0 for THF problems
175 new abstract problems, in the domains GRA LCL NUM PUZ SET SEU SWV SYN.
281 new problems, in the domains GRA LCL NUM PUZ SET SEU SWV SYN.

Changes from v3.5.0 to v3.6.0 for FOF problems
  1 new abstract problems, in the domains SYN.
  2 new problems, in the domains SYN.

Changes from v3.5.0 to v3.6.0 for CNF problems
  1 new abstract problems, in the domains SYN.
  2 new problems, in the domains SYN.

+ This is an alpha release, introducing THF problems
  - These are problems in the THF0 core syntax. Problem version numbers are
    searated from the abstract name by a "^", e.g., LCL579^1.p.
  - The Problems directory contains a THF domain, with symbolic links to all
    the THF problems. This will not exist in the full (non-alpha) release.
  - All documents and utilities have been upgraded to deal with THF0.
  - Export to TPS and OmDoc formats is available using tptp2X.
  - Only minor changes have been made to the FOF and CNF parts (the only new
    problems are the SYN000 problems, suitable for testing parsers).

+ In tptp2X
  - Upgraded statistics counts
  - Upgraded to handle THF

+ In Scripts
  - tptp1T is now longer supported, as it is superceded by tptp2T.

+ In Documents
  - The FOFStatistics and CNFStatistics have been removed, as they are
    superceded by ProblemAndSolutionStatistics.

+ In SyntaxBNF
  - Allow only visibles in single_quoted and distinct_object
  - Removed the comment that "All formulae must be closed" to accomodate
    encodings of modal logics like S5 with free variables.
  - Changed <file_name> to be <single_quoted>
  - <thf_defined_const> renamed to <thf_definition>, and extended to allow
    the constant to optionally be typed.
  - Updated the list of SZS success status values.
  - != is no longer a <defined_infix_pred>, but is treated specially,
    because it really indicates a unary formula. Necessary for CNF, and
    cleaner for THF and FOF.

  previously in the TPTP, some with over 3.3 million axioms.
+ A new utility script, tptp2T, has been added in the Scripts directory. tptp2T
  is an enhanced version of the existing tptp1T script, for extracting lists
  of problems, and now solutions, with specified characteristics. tptp2T works
  in conjunction with a new data file ProblemAndSolutionStatistics, which is
  in the Documents directory. ProblemAndSolutionStatistics combines the problem
  statistics currently in the FOFProblemStatistics and CNFProblemStatistics
  with statistics from ATP system runs on all the problems.

    previously required ()s around the quantified formula. Thanks to Allen
    van Gelder for that one.
+ tptp2X_install and tptp1T_install now respect the TPTP and TPTP_HOME
  environment variables. $TPTP can refer to the TPTP directory, and
  $TPTP_HOME to the directory containing the TPTP directory.
+ In SyntaxBNF
  - Four kinds of separators are used, to indicate different types of rules:
    ::= is used for regular grammar rules, :== is used for semantic grammar
    rules, ::- is used for rules that produce tokens, and ::: is used for
    rules that define character classes used in the construction of tokens.
  - Comments are no longer first class elements.

    literals in all types of problems (not only unit equality problems).
+ tptp1T arguments can now be negated with a leading "-". As a result some
  previously possible argument values are not needed, and have been disabled.
+ A BibTeX file containing entries for all material referenced in the TPTP has
  been added to the Documents directory. The % Refs entries in problem, axiom,
  and generator files have been reduced to a single line that includes a key
  for the bibliography file.

===============================================================================
Release v2.0.0, Thu Jun 5 15:06:26 EST 1997

v2.0.0 is the second version of the TPTP. The major changes in this version
are :

+ Three new domains have been added: FLD (Field theory), KRS (Knowledge
  Representation), and MGT (Management).
+ Difficulty ratings have been assigned to those problems for which sufficient
  performance data from state-of-the-art ATP systems is available. The ratings
  are given in a new % Rating field in the problem headers.
+ A new utility called tptp1T, for finding problems with certain user specified
  characteristics, has been added.

Other changes are given below.
===============================================================================

  3 bugfixes done, in the domains GRP SYN.

+ This is the sixth public release.
+ The % Version fields have been reviewed. Problems that are "Special" have
  been explicitly labelled as such.
+ The % Syntax field of CNF problems has been extended to include the average
  number of literals per clause and the average term depth.
+ The tptp2X utility has been extended and improved :
  - Four new CNF output formats: CLIN-S, DFG, DIMACS, ILF.
  - Four FOF output formats: TPTP, DFG, Otter, OSCAR.
  - Nine new transformations: clausify (4 FOF to CNF transformations), simplify
    (simplifies a set of clauses), cnf (clausify then simplify), er (reverses
    arguments in the clauses of unit equality problems), ran_er (does the er
    transformation to randomly selected clauses).
  - The format modules now receive an extra argument containing the file
    header information. This information may be used only for supplementary
    documentation of the problem.
+ The TPTP technical report has been updated.
===============================================================================
Release v1.2.1, Wed Jun 12 08:53:00 MET DST 1996

Changes from v1.2.0 to v1.2.1
0 new abstract problems.
0 new problems.
233 bugfixes done, in the domains BOO GEO GRP HEN NUM PUZ RNG SET SYN.

+ This is the fifth public release, and will be used in the CADE-13 ATP System
  Competition.
+ If the axiomatization used in a problem has been formed by reducing and
  augmenting an existing axiomatization, and the result is complete but also
  non-standard due to redundancy, this is noted with "(Non-standard)" in the
  % Version field.
+ The % Syntax field has been extended to include counts of range restricted
  clauses, and the arity ranges of the predicate and function symbols.
+ The tptp2X utility has been extended and improved :
  - One new output format: SPASS.
  - Two new transformations: to_equality and add_equality.
  - The equality removal transformation has been renamed to rm_equality, and
    now fails if the equality axiomatization is incomplete.
  - The shorten transformation no longer shortens equal to eq (i.e., equal/2
    always remains as the equality predicate).
+ In problems where the equality axiomatization was incomplete, the equal/2
  predicate has been renamed to equalish/2.
+ The clause type information has been reviewed and four corrections were made.
  Throughout the TPTP the "theorem" type has been replaced by "conjecture".
