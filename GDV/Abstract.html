<H3> Abstract </H3>

<P>
Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) systems are complex pieces of software,
and thus may have bugs that make them unsound.
In order to guard against such unsoundness, the derivations output by 
an ATP system may be <EM>semantically</EM> verified by a trusted system 
that checks the required semantic properties of each inference step.
Such verification may need to be augmented by structural verification 
that checks that inferences have been used correctly in the context of 
the overall derivation.
This paper describes techniques for semantic verification of derivations, 
and reports on their implementation in the GDV verifier.
