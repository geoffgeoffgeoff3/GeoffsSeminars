<H3> Abstract </H3>

The TPTP (Thousands of Problems for Theorem Provers) World is a well 
established infrastructure for Automated Theorem Proving (ATP). 
In the context of the TPTP World, the TPTP Process Instruction (TPI) language 
provides capabilities to input, output, and organize logical formulae, and 
to control the execution of ATP systems. 
This paper reviews the TPI language, describes a shell interpreter for the 
language, and demonstrates how useful they can be in theorem proving.
