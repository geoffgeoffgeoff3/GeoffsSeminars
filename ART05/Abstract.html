<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) is concerned with the development and use of 
systems that automate sound reasoning: the derivation of conclusions that 
follow inevitably from facts. 
A <EM>Rich Theory</EM> is one whose axioms (expressed in 
1st order logic) contain a large number of predicates and functors, and whose 
theorems are often provable from a subset of the axioms. While theorems in 
rich theories are often hard for an individual ATP system to prove, the 
richness provides sources of information and opportunities to use high level 
ATP techniques intelligent ways. This seminar outlines several interlinked 
projects whose common goal is to prove hard theorems in rich theories, using 
ATP systems within higher level control systems. The projects include analysis 
and selection of axioms for proving a given conjecture, the automatic 
generation and use of lemmas, cooperative competition between ATP systems, and 
semantic verification of proofs.
