     <TD ALIGN=JUSTIFY> <STRONG>Language</STRONG><BR>
          A common language that all systems can parse, or for which there
          are translators to the systems' native languages.
          The competition problems need to be presented equally to all
          systems in a competition.
     <TD ALIGN=JUSTIFY> 
          TPTP language. 
          TPTP2X/TPTP4X to translate.
     <TD ALIGN=JUSTIFY> 
          English? ACE/CELT?
<TR VALIGN=TOP> 
     <TD ALIGN=JUSTIFY> <STRONG>Theories</STRONG><BR>
          Background theories upon which specific queries/conjectures can
          be based.
     <TD ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
          TPTP axiom files.
     <TD ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
          SUMO?
<TR VALIGN=TOP> 
     <TD ALIGN=JUSTIFY> <STRONG>Problems</STRONG><BR>
          A collection of problems that the community agrees are representative
          of possible "real-world" applications of the systems.
          These can be used for a competition.
     <TD ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
          The TPTP problem library, including the identification of problems
          that are "biased" - not representative of possible "real-world" 
          applications.
     <TD ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
          The biology book.
<TR VALIGN=TOP> 
     <TD ALIGN=JUSTIFY> <STRONG>Specialist Problem Classes</STRONG> (SPCs)<BR>
          A division of the problems so that each division is homogeneous 
          wrt ATP systems.
          These form the basis for competition divisions, so that entrants
          in a division are, in principle, able to attempt all problems in
          the division.
     <TD ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
          TPTP SPCs, which are based on logical, language, and syntactic
          characteristics.
     <TD ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
          ????
<TR VALIGN=TOP> 
     <TD ALIGN=JUSTIFY> <STRONG>Solutions</STRONG><BR>
          A collection of solutions for the problems, which provide the basis
          for deciding which problems should be eligible for a competition.
     <TD ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
          The TSTP solution library.
     <TD ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
          ????
<TR VALIGN=TOP> 
     <TD ALIGN=JUSTIFY> <STRONG>Ratings</STRONG><BR>
          A rating of the problems that indicates the difficulty of the problems
          wrt potential competition entrants.
          Problems that all systems solve, and problems that no systems solve,
          are of little interest in a competition.
          Therefore it is necessary to know inadvance what's realistically
          possible.
     <TD ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
          TPTP problem ratings.

<TR VALIGN=TOP> 
     <TD ALIGN=JUSTIFY> <STRONG>Competition Organization</STRONG><BR>
          There are many aspects to this, but there are some general ideas:
          <UL>
          <LI> A dedicated organizing team or not more than 3 people.
          <LI> A panel of respected researchers, who are independent of the
               organizers, who adjudicate and decide on any disagreements
               regarding conformance and interpretation of the rules.
          <LI> Pre-determined rules, which are generally agreed upon as
               "reasonable" by the community and the entrants.
               These must be announced far enough in advance for entrants to
               adpat their systems for the competition.
          </UL>
     <TD ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
          <UL>
          <LI> Geoff Sutcliffe, and previously Christian Suttner
          <LI> Panel of 3 appointed each year, with some continuity.
          <LI> Provided online about 5 months in advance.
          </UL>
     <TD ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<TR VALIGN=TOP> 
     <TD ALIGN=JUSTIFY> <STRONG>Stimulating Environment</STRONG><BR>
          Do not let "evaluation" dominate.
          A competition must be equally about stimulating research, and
          providing an environment in which researchers can productively
          interact.
     <TD ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
          CASC dinner.
          Real time competition in one day, with online results displayed
          in a public area at a conference.

          ????
<TR VALIGN=TOP> 
     <TD ALIGN=JUSTIFY> <STRONG>Resources</STRONG><BR>
          Enough compute power is necessary to run a competition in one day,
          to maximize the stimulating impact.
     <TD ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
          Various, but most recently the MPII cluster and the University
          of Manchester clusters.
          Hopefully soon the StarExec cluster.
     <TD ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
          The StarExec cluster ????
<TR VALIGN=TOP> 
     <TD ALIGN=JUSTIFY> <STRONG>Recognition</STRONG><BR>
          The system developers (entrants) are the people who do the hardest
          work, and their efforts must be seriously recognized.
     <TD ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
          Trophies.
          Recognition in the published competition report.
