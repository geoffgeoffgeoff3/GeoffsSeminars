<H3> Abstract </H3>

This talk analyses the evaluation infrastructure that underlies the
CADE ATP System Competition (CASC), to provide a coherent set of issues that
might be usefully considered when designing a new competition for another
type of logic-solver.
In particular, this paper aims to provide guidance for establishing a
Deep Knowledge Representation competition.
