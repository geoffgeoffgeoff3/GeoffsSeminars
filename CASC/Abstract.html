<H3> Abstract </H3>

The CADE ATP System Competition (CASC) is the annual evaluation of fully
automatic, classical logic Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) systems - the
world championship for such systems. Besides the obvious aim of evaluating
ATP systems, CASC stimulates ATP research, motivates development and
implementation of robust ATP systems that are useful and easily deployed in
applications, provides an inspiring environment for personal interaction
between ATP researchers, and exposes ATP systems within and beyond the ATP
community. This talk covers the past, present, and future of CASC.
