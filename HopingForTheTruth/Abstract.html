A Survey of the TPTP Logics</A>

<H3> Abstract </H3>

This work compares features of the classical logics that are commonly
used in the TPTP-based automated reasoning community for representing
chosen aspects of "the world", and the consequent implications for
reasoning about these representations.
It is argued that increases in complexity in terms of representation
and reasoning force users to compromise between the reliability of
the representation and the reliability of the reasoning.
