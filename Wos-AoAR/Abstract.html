<H1 ALIGN=CENTER> The Arrival of Automated Reasoning </H1>

<H3> Abstract </H3>

<P>
For some, the object of automated reasoning is the design and implementation
of a program that offers sufficient power to enable one to contribute new and 
significant results to mathematics and to logic, as well as elsewhere. 
One measure of success rests with the number and quality of the results 
obtained with the assistance of the program in focus. 
A less obvious measure (heavily in focus here) rests with the ability of a 
novice in the domain under investigation, to make significant contributions 
to one or more fields of science by relying heavily on a given reasoning
program. 
For example, if one who is totally unfamiliar with the area of study but
skilled in automated reasoning can discover with an automated reasoning 
program impressive proofs, previously unknown axiom dependencies, and far 
more, then the field of automated reasoning has indeed arrived. 
This article details how one such novice, with much experience with 
W.&nbsp;McCune's program OTTER, but no knowledge of the domains under 
investigation, obtained startling results in the study of areas of logic 
that include the <EM>BCSK</EM> logic and various extensions of that logic.
Among those results was the discovery of a <EM>variety</EM> weaker than has 
been studied from what we know, a variety that appears to merit serious study, 
as, for example, does the study of semigroups when compared with that of the 
study of groups. 
A quite different result concerns the discovery of a most unexpected 
dependency in two extensions of the <EM>BCSK</EM> logic.
