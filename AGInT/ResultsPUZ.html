Someone who lives in Dreadbury Mansion killed Aunt Agatha.

and are the only people who live therein. A killer always
hates his victim, and is never richer than his victim.

everyone except the butler. The butler hates everyone not
richer than Aunt Agatha. The butler hates everyone Aunt
Agatha hates. No one hates everyone. Agatha is not the 
butler.</EM>

<H3> Truthtellers and Liars </H3>
<EM>
On a certain island the inhabitants are partitioned into those
who always tell the truth and those who always lie. I landed on
the island and met three inhabitants A, B, and C. I asked A,
'Are you a truthteller or a liar?' He mumbled something which I
couldn't make out. I asked B what A had said. B replied, 'A
said he was a liar'. C then volunteered, 'Don't believe B, he's
lying!' </EM>
<UL>
<LI> C is a truthteller
<LI> B is a liar
</UL>
