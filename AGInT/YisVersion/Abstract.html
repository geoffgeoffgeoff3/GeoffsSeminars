<H3> Abstract </H3>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
A primary mode of operation of ATP systems is to
supply the system with axioms and a conjecture,
and to then ask the system to produce a proof (or at least an
assurance that there is a proof) that the conjecture is a theorem of
the axioms.
This paper challenges ATP to a new mode of operation, by which
interesting theorems are generated from a set of axioms.
The challenge requires solutions to both theoretical and computational
issues.
