<H1 ALIGN=CENTER> Automated Generation of Interesting Theorems </H1>

<H3> Abstract </H3>

<P>
In the theory of a set of axioms there are many boring logical
consequences, and scattered among them there are a few interesting ones.
The few interesting ones include those that are singled out as 
<EM>theorems</EM> by human experts in the domain.
This paper describes the techniques, implementation, and results of a
automated system that generates logical consequences of a set of axioms,
and uses filters and ranking to identify interesting theorems among the
logical consequences.
It is capable of generating and identifying interesting theorems that
have not been explicitly identified by human experts.
