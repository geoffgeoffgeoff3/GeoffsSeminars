<H3> Abstract </H3>

This paper describes how the homogeneity of sets of ATP problems
can be measured with respect to the performance of ATP systems.
Measuring homogeneity is important as a basis for empirical evaluation
of ATP systems and problems.
A machine learning approach has been used to differentiate between types 
of problems in situations where heterogeneity is apparent.
