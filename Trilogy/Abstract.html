<H3> Abstract </H3>

This seminar gives an overview of three interelated projects:

<DL>
<DT> TPTP
     <DD> The <EM>Thousands of Problems for Theorem Provers</EM> Problem 
          Library is a library of test problems for automated theorem 
          proving (ATP) systems.
          The TPTP supplies the ATP community with a comprehensive library 
          of the ATP test problems that are available today. 
          The principal aim of this project is to move the evaluation 
          of ATP systems from the previously ad hoc situation onto a firm 
          footing. 
          This became necessary, as results being published do not always 
          accurately reflect the capabilities of the ATP system being 
          considered.
<DT> CASC
     <DD> The <EM>CADE ATP System Competition</EM> is an annual event that 
          evaluates ATP systems in terms of their ability to solve problems 
          chosen from the TPTP. 
          Besides the obvious aim of evaluating ATP systems, CASC stimulates 
          ATP research and implementation of working autonomous ATP systems, 
          provides an inspiring environment for personal interaction between 
          ATP researchers, and exposes ATP systems to researchers both within 
          and outside the ATP community.
<DT> SSCPA
     <DD> The <EM>Smart Selective Competition Parallelism</EM> ATP system is 
          an uncooperative multiple calculus competition parallelism ATP 
          system, that multitasks on a single CPU. 
          SSCPA runs multiple sequential ATP systems in parallel, using 
          performance data from the ATP systems to select those that are 
          best suited to the problem. 
          As a meta-system, SSCPA outperformed all other systems in the 
          <CODE>MIX</CODE> and <CODE>SAT</CODE> divisions of CASC-16.
