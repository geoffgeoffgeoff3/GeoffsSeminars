<H3> Abstract </H3>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
A <EM>Rich Theory</EM> is one whose axioms (expressed in 1st order logic) 
contain a large number of predicates and functors, and whose theorems are 
often provable from a subset of the axioms.
Examples of rich theories are set theory, geometry, and homological algebra.
The complexity and scope of rich theories contribute to the difficulty of 
finding proofs of theorems using Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) systems.
This seminar describes techniques that have been developed to improve the
performance of ATP systems on theorems in rich theories.
