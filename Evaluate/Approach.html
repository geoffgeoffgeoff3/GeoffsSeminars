<H1 ALIGN=CENTER> Approach and Principles </H1>

<H3> Approach </H3>
<UL>
<LI> Analysis not possible in the 1st order case
<LI> Empirical measurement based on ATP system performance is required
<LI> Problem rating is <EM>by</EM> and <EM>for</EM> ATP systems
     <UL>
     <LI> Problem rating within <A HREF="SPCs.html">SPCs</A>
     </UL>
<LI> Only know ranking of systems within SPCs
     <UL>
     <LI> Problem ratings based on only solutions found
     </UL>
<LI> Avoid influence by large number of weak systems
     <UL>
     <LI> Use only <A HREF="SysSubs.html">SOTA contributors</A>
     </UL>
</UL>

<H3> Principles </H3>
<UL>
<LI> If all systems solve a problem, it is as easy as possible; lowest rating
<LI> If no systems solve a problem, it is as hard as possible; highest rating
<LI> As more systems are able to solve the problem, the rating decreases
</UL>
