<H3> Approach </H3>
<UL>
<LI> Easy problems are solved by all decent systems, and <BR>
     Unsolved problems do not differentiate between systems
     <UL>
     <LI> Use difficult problems

</UL>

<H3> Rating Scheme </H3>
<UL>
<LI> The <STRONG>fraction of difficult problems it can solve</STRONG>
     <PRE>
              Number of difficult problems solved by the system
Rating = -----------------------------------------------------------
         Number of difficult problems solved by any SOTA contributor     </PRE>

<! Strengths and Weaknesses
<! Ranks systems that are not comparable in System Ranking by Subsumption
<! Scale is non-linear
     <! A ratio of scores is usually not meaningful
<! All problems are considered equal
     <! All systems get the benefit
<! Does not rank systems that solve the same number of problems.
