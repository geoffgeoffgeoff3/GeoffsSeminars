SPASS-XDB - Automated Reasoning with World Knowledge
</H1>

<H3> Abstract </H3>

There is a growing demand for automated reasoning with <EM>world 
knowledge</EM>. 
For example, a reasoning system with knowledge of what cities are located 
near water, and access to data describing current weather conditions, would 
be able to predict which cities might be flooded (e.g., by tidal surge). 
World knowledge is available from a growing number of sources, e.g., online 
databases, SPARQL endpoints, web services, computational systems, and search 
engines. 
Static sources provide a large but finite number of facts, while dynamic and 
computational sources can provide infinitely many facts by generating them 
on demand. 
For deep reasoning, world knowledge is used in conjunction with ontological 
axioms that describe the structure of the world in which the knowledge 
resides. 
Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) systems have traditionally not been well 
suited to reasoning with world knowledge (where the facts are viewed as 
positive unit axioms), because they expect to load all the formulae before 
deduction starts. 
The large (possibly infinite) number of axioms available from world knowledge 
sources dictates that the axioms be retrieved dynamically during deduction.
SPASS-XDB is an ATP system that incorporates world knowledge axioms from 
multiple external sources, asynchronously on demand, during its deduction 
process. 
This talk describes the general architecture of SPASS-XDB, and provides 
some details of the most recent developments integrating Mathematica and 
internet search engines as sources of world knowledge axioms.
