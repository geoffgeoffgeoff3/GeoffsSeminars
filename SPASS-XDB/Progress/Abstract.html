Progress Towards Effective<BR>Automated Reasoning with World Knowledge
</H1>

<H3> Abstract </H3>

There is a growing demand for automated reasoning with world knowledge.
SPASS-XDB is an automated reasoning system that incorporates world
knowledge from multiple external sources, asynchronously on demand, during
its reasoning process.
This work describes how SPASS-XDB's reasoning is focussed and
controlled, its sources of world knowledge, and their use in solving a range
of test problems.
